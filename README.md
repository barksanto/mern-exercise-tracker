# MERN stack Exercist Tracker CRUD application.
M = MongoDB (We'll use Mongoose to make it easier for Node.js to work with MongoDB, and we'll use MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database, but cloud).
E = Express (makes it easier to work with Node.js.).
R = React (for the frontend. Bootstrap for styling, react-router-dom for React routes, react-datepicker for React Datepicker component).
N = Node.js (for the server. We'll use dotenv to load environment variables from an .env file into process.env, and nodemon to make the app auto-restart when you edit/save files).

After cloning the repository we will have 2 servers running. 

1.) Backend so we can access the DB 
- Navigate to backend directory and run terminal command 'nodemon server'

2.) So we are able to see the project on your localhost:5000
-npm install
-npm start

From there you will be able to add users to the database, add as many as you'd like! then you can Create an Exercise Log for any user in the db by selecting their name from the dropdown, inputting the type of exercise and the duration (in minutes).

Enjoy!
